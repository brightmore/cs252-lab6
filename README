Steps to set up dev environment

1. Create a github account and upload your public key
   Goto github.com/jtbates/cs252-lab6 and click watch.  I will add you as a 
   collaborator.
2. Install Android SDK and the ADT Plugin in Eclipse.
3. Install EGit in Eclipse (http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates)
4. Clone the repo in your Eclipse workspace directory
   git clone git@github.com:jtbates/cs252-lab6.git lab6
5. In Eclipse, go to Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace and 
   select the lab6 folder (you might need to run Clean... to get it to build)
